* Networking Commands in Linux
There are several Linux packages to deal with network-related commands, eg
=net-tools=, =iproute2= etc. Since =net-tools= is deprecated, many of its
commands now have =iproute2= alternatives.

** Ping
ping (Packet INternet Groper) is a utility normally used for testing connectivity between two systems on a network
(Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN)). It uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to
communicate to nodes on a network.

#+end_example
** IP Addresses
=ip address show= can list the IP address and other networking interfaces
available on the machine.
#+begin_example
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eno1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether f8:ca:b8:59:6f:8a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp0s25
3: wlp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 10:02:b5:6d:41:ab brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.243/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp2s0
       valid_lft 1966sec preferred_lft 1966sec
    inet6 2405:201:300c:306d:ac6c:3882:2155:b727/64 scope global dynamic noprefixroute 
       valid_lft 3581sec preferred_lft 3581sec
    inet6 fe80::27b9:d541:caa6:cf44/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
#+end_example

In this case, the IP address of my machine, through the ~wlp2s0~ interface is =192.168.1.243=.
** netstat
netstat is a command-line tool that displays useful information such as network connections, routing tables, interface
statistics, and much more, concerning the Linux networking subsystem. It is useful for network troubleshooting and
performance analysis.
=netstat -all=
#+begin_example
Active Internet connections (servers and established)

#+end_example
** ss
ss (socket statistics) is a powerful command-line utility to investigate sockets. It dumps socket statistics and displays
information similar to netstat. In addition, it shows more TCP and state information compared to other similar
utilities.
=ss -t=

** nmap
=nmap= (Network Mapper) is a powerful and extremely versatile tool for Linux system/network administrators. It is
used to gather information about a single host or explores networks an entire network. Nmap is also used to perform
security scans, network audits and finding open ports on remote hosts and so much more.

=sudo nmap 192.168.1.243/24=
#+begin_example
