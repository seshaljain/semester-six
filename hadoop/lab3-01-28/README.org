* Hadoop initialization
We can check if Hadoop has been installed correctly by running the =start-all= script which creates namenodes and datanodes

* Creating directory
We use Hadoop's =fs= utility to create a directory on =hdfs=

* Creating and copying file to HDFS
Running =fs= with =-copyFromLocal= copies data from local filesystem to HDFS on Hadoop cluster

Comparing =md5= hashes of the two files proves that they are identical
